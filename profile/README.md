## Tools

Fauna Labs includes tools to help you manage your Fauna databases. 


### Cloudflare Workers template

Use the [Fauna Cloudflare Workers template](https://github.com/fauna-labs/cloudflare_workers_REST) to build a globally distributed REST API using Cloudflare Workers. 

### Fauna Serverless Framework plugin

The [Fauna plugin](https://github.com/fauna-labs/serverless-fauna) for the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) lets you manage Fauna databases and resources directly from your *serverless.yml* file. You can integrate it into your test and CI/CD pipelines to sync your databases across multiple environments.

There's also an [example repository](https://github.com/fauna-labs/serverless-fauna-example) that shows how the plugin can create and manage collections, indexes, roles, and user-defined functions (UDFs).

### Fauna Github Action
The [Fauna Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/fauna_db_actions) lets you manage Fauna resources in the CI/CD pipeline using the Fauna Schema Language (FSL). 

## Sample Apps

Fauna Labs provides several sample apps to show how you can use Fauna in the context of a full application.

### Todo app
